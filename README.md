PyCharm Theme for VSCode
========================

Two themes inspired by PyCharm for Visual Studio Code.

### PyCharm Color Scheme Dark ###

A theme mimicking PyCharm's Darcula theme.

### PyCharm Color Scheme Light ###

A custom light theme with its own set of colors. Colors are different from the dark scheme, however all code elements who share the same color
in PyCharm Dark also share the same color in this theme.
